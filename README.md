# Trendgrambot

Hashtags are a new addition to telegram. They are often used by spammers who post bad content on telegram but the stories are pretty cool to see on telegram.

With the events of France Telegram is very likely to get rid of these spammers, not to mention Telegrams financial situation is not the best and these spammers make it worse by stealing views from the ads. Im sure telegram will fix it very soon.

This bot is a simple bot that generates hashtags for any piece of text using Meta-LLM models from cloudflare. So when you get the response from the bot you can simply click the hashtags to go discover stories and hopefully in a near future very cool posts with less spam.
